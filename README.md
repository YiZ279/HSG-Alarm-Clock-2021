## Introduction
This is a mandatory group project  of the courses “HS21-7,789,1.00 Skills: Programming with Advanced Computer Languages” supervised by Dr. Mario Silic in the autumn semester 2021, at the University of St. Gallen. The project was done in a group of six people: Patrick Aoun, Rachel Dingemanse, Andras Krämer, Josef Krutel, Mariana Tomas Mendes and Yi Zheng.

## General-Content
The program offers students and other people going to the University of St. Gallen or living in St. Gallen a special alarm setting system. The student can choose between the option 1) set alarm for University or option 2) set normal alarm. If the student choose to set the alarm for the University, the program first asks the student when they need to be at University, and in a next step outputs the latest bus they can take to be still on time. The student can then decide 

The program furthermore offers additional features, such as choosing their own ringing tone for the alarm, or a countdown to the alarm.

## Repository
There are five files distributed within this repository. "README.md" is used for a project description as well as instructions. "XX.ipynb" and "XX.py" contain code. 

## Installations 
To do our analysis we use these programs: 
* Python 3.9 (This program was developed for and tested with Python 3.9. The program may also work with previous Python versions, but this was not tested.)
* Anaconda 3
* Jupyter Notebook

To run our code you will need the following packages: 
* e.g. numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, pylab, sklearn, statsmodels.api, tkinter
