    "## About the Project\n",
    "\n",
    "The program consists of a customized alarm clock integrated with the city bus schedule, which helps HSG students to never run late for university again, saving them from the struggles of missing the bus and having to walk up the hill. Most students who live in the city center of St. Gallen need to either walk to university or take the bus number 5 or 9 from the train station. Due to convenience, bus number 9 is favoured by most of the students as it stops right next to the university. Therefore, our alarm clock works with the bus number 9 schedule. Moreover, for simplicity, we have designed the alarm for departure from the St. Gallen train station only, as most students take the bus from there to arrive at the university. \n",
    "\n",
    "The program offers students a special alarm setting system by providing the following features: First, the user is asked to tick a box if he/she wants to go to university. If the user does not tick the box then the time he/she sets is the time of the alarm. Here, the program is used as a regular alarm clock. If the user needs to go to uni, they have to input the time they need to be at university. Furthermore, the user is asked how long he/she needs to get ready by inputting the necessary hours/minutes. This includes breakfast, morning routines, time for the travel to the bus station, etc. The program compares the arrival times of the bus number 9 at the university (departing from the train station) to the indicated preferred arrival time of the user at university and selects the bus, which has the closest timely arrival. According to the bus schedule, the bus needs six minutes to get from the train station to the university. The departure time of the student from the train station is calculated by deducting 6 minutes from the arrival time of Bus 9 at uni. From this bus departure time, the program deducts the time that it takes the user to get ready and be at the bus station. The output is the time when the alarm rings. Additionally, the program allows the user to customize the alarm ringing tone by inputting an URL (e.g. Youtube Link)."
